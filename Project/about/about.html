      Sweet Memory Rustic Photography was created by Michelle Martin in the small town of Jackson, Georgia. Michelle started her photography business by herself and based all of her original albums on her friends and family. Now, her buisness continues to grow and expand out of that small town with every captured moment. With professionalism and just a touch of southern comfort, the memories that we capture will carry on for years to come.
